Gemtrust financial packages are designed to generate funds using simple strategies like network marketing and financial intelligence. The packages allow you create trust funds by committing an initial fee which serves as fund to other beneficiaries. After completion and verification of your transaction, you are required to introduce 5 new clients to form a sub network under you. This new chain now generates the funds which are saved in your trust fund. The same process is repeated to all new members.
The trust packages are divided into stages One to Four. The first stage, client will receive contribution from 5 persons, the second stage will be 25, persons. The third stage is 125 contributions or payouts. Fourth stage is 625 at which members will exit the program and will be awarded the entire saved up trust fund.
<br>
Clients can request for their trust fund anytime from stage 2.</br>
Members can exit their trust package and continue again.</br>
Members are allowed to create any number of trust packages.
